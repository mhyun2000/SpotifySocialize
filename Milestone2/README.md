# [Spotify Socialize]
## Group [J]: Milestone 2

## What is Done:
The welcome page and the home page are created according to the wireframes. The authentication has been established and now users are able to login and create an account utilizing the Spotify API tool. The welcome, home, contact, about, and logout pages have been created and the front end has been partially developed on these pages. The API requests are working and the frontend is connected to the backend. The database has been created and is setup but the tables have not been populated yet.

## What is Not Done:
The database is currently empty and needs to be filled with the requests and the home, logout, login, about, and contact pages need to be finished in terms of the interface and functionalities for the Milestone 3. The tables for the database are not populated yet.
