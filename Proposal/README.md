# Title: Spotify Socialize

# Problem Statement: 
Music is an important part of what makes a good party. If everyone involved knows and enjoys the music it greatly enhances the overall experience. However, putting together a playlist that incorporates the interests of everyone in the group can be a difficult task. Organizers of a party may want to find songs or artists that those coming to the party may listen to and create a tailored playlist, but lack the necessary resources to view this information and quickly create such a playlist. As such, our web application aims to solve this problem by quickly generating a list of shared songs amongst Spotify users and their friends/contacts. Currently Spotify does not support such functionality and creating a tailored playlist like this would require the user to manually go through each and every personâ€™s playlists. The user would have to manually compare each and every song and artist in each of these playlists to finally create a playlist with songs that they are all familiar with. Thus, the primary goal of our app would be to help to automate and speed up this process and facilitate socialization among users of the Spotify platform.

# Features/Functionalities: 
After opening the application, users will be able to log into this application with their Spotify account. Upon logging in, users of the web app will be able to select one or more Spotify users to recommend songs that are shared between you and the user or group of users that they have selected. These recommendations will only be generated by analyzing the selected Spotify user(s) publicly available playlists. There there will be an option to generate a playlist of these shared songs/artists that the user has in common with the selected group of one or more Spotify users. Another feature the app may include is a simple algorithm to suggest songs and artists based on what other users have been listening to. An example may be suggesting a song that two of your friends have been listening to but you are completely unfamiliar with. A third feature that we can put on top of finding similar songs with the user is to use an algorithm to find other users that have these similar songs and have the option to add them as a follower. This would facilitate socialization among previously unfamiliar Spotify users and enable them to find new people sharing similar song/musical interests.
