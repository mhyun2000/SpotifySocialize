<p>Music is an important part of our lives and many people use Spotify to listen to music. It sounds even better when you're listening with someone who has the same music tastes as you. However, putting together a playlist that incorporates the interests of everyone in a group can be a time-consuming task. Spotify users may want to find songs or artists to create a tailored playlist with their friends, but they lack the necessary resources to view this information and quickly create such a playlist. Our web application aims to solve this problem by generating a list of shared songs amongst Spotify users and their friends that log in through this app, saving a lot of time. Currently Spotify does not support such functionality and creating a playlist like this would require the user to manually go through each and every personâ€™s playlists. The user would have to compare each song and artist in their playlists to create a playlist with music that they are all familiar with. Thus, the primary goal of our app would be to help to automate and speed up this process and facilitate socialization among Spotify users.
